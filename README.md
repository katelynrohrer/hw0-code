## Instructions

Use the following commands to initialize your virtual environment: \
`python3 -m venv .env` \
`source .env/bin/activate` \
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


Then, edit the function in `start_here.py` to return the sum of both parameters. \
To test your code locally, run `pytest`.\
The **exact same** test cases are run automatically on GitHub after each push.

If you pass the test cases locally, you will see something similar to the following:

Once you push your code to GitHub, GitHub will automatically run the test cases and give you your feedback. If all test cases pass, you will see the following:
![git-pass.png](..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2FDownloads%2Fgit-pass.png)
